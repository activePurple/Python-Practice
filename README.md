# My Python Journey
Over time I will update it with new small projects and simple tasks that are for problem solving. Games as I work on them and just hobby projects, this is my attempt to not only learn but also organize my thoughts and material in clear and cohesive way.

### Current Code Snips
- Calculations.py: Simple electrical calculations that is being expanded with more formulas to come
- CoffeeChatBot: A small chatbot project done from codecademy that was a great learning experience
- Various others that are smaller examples of working with different types of data
